# Verification-of-FIR-filter
### Building a Matlab FIR Golden Model and generating 3 input noisy signals each one of different frequency. 
### Building full UVM environment that consists of 3 sequence items each one takes one generated signal from Matlab
### Comparing the output with the output from the Golden Model in the Scoreboard.
